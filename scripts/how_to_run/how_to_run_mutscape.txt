##### HOW TO RUN MUTSCAPE #####

# Go to folder where the software is
cd ./omics/groups/OE0436/data/jimenez/tools/MutScape/MutScape/mutscape

# Load miniconda module 
module load miniconda/4.9.2

# Initialize conda 
conda init

# Activate conda environment 
bash
conda activate /omics/groups/OE0436/data/jimenez/tools/MutScape/MutScape/mutscape

# And if not, create one: 
conda create -p path/to/environment

# MutScape has several tools that allow to carry out different analyses and obtain different outputs
# To obtain a list of the significantly mutated genes:
# Noteworthy to point that this analysis generates first two .txt files (oncodriveCLUST.nonsyn.txt and oncodriveCLUST.syn.txt) that serve as input for the oncodrive tool, which 
# computes the significance. The output with the list of genes and their significance is generated in an oncodriveclust_results.tsv
python3 mafAnalysis.py -f /omics/groups/OE0436/data/jimenez/data/snv.maf -smg -o /omics/groups/OE0436/data/jimenez/outputs -p /omics/groups/OE0436/data/jimenez/outputs

# Another tool is to get known cancer gene annotation. It generates another maf file (kcga.output.maf) that adds some annotation information on the genes
python3 mafAnalysis.py -f /omics/groups/OE0436/data/jimenez/data/snv.maf -kcga -o /omics/groups/OE0436/data/jimenez/outputs -p /omics/groups/OE0436/data/jimenez/outputs

# MutScape can also compute Tumor Burden Statistics. This tool generates two files. In TMB_analysis.tsv we get an analysis per sample, which shows the total number of mutations, 
# nonsynonymous mutations and the TMB estimation. In the TMB_statistics.tsv, we get general statistics parameters (mean, median...) for TMB and mutations
python3 mafAnalysis.py -f /omics/groups/OE0436/data/jimenez/data/snv.maf -tmb 60456963 -o /omics/groups/OE0436/data/jimenez/outputs -p /omics/groups/OE0436/data/jimenez/outputs

# As for the CoMut plot tool, it requires two commands, the first one generating two files required to build the plot. However, the second command requires more data, among which
# files on CNA per sample, purity... are needed. For the moment, I have not used it

# For the mutational signature tool, there is a column required "flanking_bps" that I don't know what information requires


# If ModuleNotFoundError pops up due to lack of a Python module, try to install with command pip install name_of_package


# When starting from vcf files, a preprocessing to convert it to maf files can be performed through dataPreprocess.py, but it requires vcf2maf tool, which I have not been able to install
