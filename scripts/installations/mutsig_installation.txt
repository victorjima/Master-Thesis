For mutsig usage, two modules are required: 
module load mcr/9.0.1
module load mutsig/1.41

For information on its usage: 
run_MutSigCV.sh

Usage:
/software/mutsig/1.41/bin/run_MutSigCV.sh <deployedMCRroot> args

For its usage, a maf file is required, along with a coverage and covariates text. Both coverage and covariates are the ones provided by the software and may be found 
at /omics/groups/OE0436/data/jimenez/data/MutSig

I have not been able to run it. The usage requires an mcr path that I have not been able to ellucidate. And the same error always appears saying it cannot open a matlab library 
(which could be related to the fact that the mcr root is not correctly specified)
