The modules required for the installation of this tool in the cluster were:
module load miniconda/4.9.2

Python is required for the usage of this tool. But loading miniconda along with miniconda might give errors, so python may be installed within the environment:
conda install python=3.7.0

The installation of MutScape has been carried out with the following commands:

Clone the git repository with all the files and scripts required
git clone https://github.com/anitalu724/MutScape.git

Move to the correspondent folder:
cd MutScape/mutscape

For its usage, a new conda environment is recommended to be created, with these commands:
bash
conda init
conda create -p /omics/groups/OE0436/data/jimenez/tools/MutScape/MutScape/mutscape
conda activate /omics/groups/OE0436/data/jimenez/tools/MutScape/MutScape/mutscape

Install some dependencies:
conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge samtools=1.10 ucsc-liftover=377 bcftools=1.10.2 htslib==1.10.2
conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge -c defaults ensembl-vep=102.0

That way, the installation module must be run:
bash installation/install_module.sh

Change permision in MutScape python scripts
chmod +x dataPreprocess.py mafAnalysis.py

Export paths
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/omics/groups/OE0436/data/jimenez/tools/MutScape/MutScape/mutscape/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

export PATH=/omics/groups/OE0436/data/jimenez/tools/MutScape/MutScape/mutscape/:$PATH

MutScape actually depends on another tool: oncodriveclust. To install it: 
pip install oncodriveclust

If the MutScape code is run and errors appear indicating that a given python module is not found, it should be installed:
pip install package
