Hello,

This is a repository containing my scripts used for all the analyses performed for my Master Thesis in the context of the MSc Omics Data Analysis (2021-2022), 
and conducted in the Division of Applied Bioinformatics at the German Cancer Research Center (Heidelberg). 

A summary of the scripts:

- K28.Rmd: obtains a figure with information on available data for all patients
- merge_vcf.Rmd: merges .vcf files of individual patients and obtain a single .vcf file containing more than one sample
- vcf_to_maf.Rmd: transforms the .vcf files obtained by the DKFZ pipeline into .maf format files
- merge_counts.Rmd: transforms available expression data output by the DKFZ format to counts/tpm matrices ready for analysis
- merge_cnv.Rmd: transforms available CNA data to TCN matrices
- oncoprint_karyogram.Rmd: obtains oncoprints and karyograms to depict mutational landscape
- significant_genes_mutscape.Rmd: analyses MutScape results and performs enrichment 
- somatic_mutations.Rmd: describes mutational landscape, analysis on TMB and tries to look at lost mutations
- mutation_signatures.Rmd: analysis of mutation signatures results 
- immune_ssGSEA.Rmd: single sample GSEA with expression data to obtain enrichment of immune cell populations
- deconvolution.Rmd: MCPCounter deconvolution analysis
- immune_deconvolution.Rmd: ESTIMATE algorithm analysis and installation of immunedeconv package
- rnaseq_DEA.Rmd: differential expression analysis of pre-treatment samples with DESeq2
- rnaseq_DEA.Rmd: differential expression analysis of pre-treatment samples with DESeq2
- integration.Rmd: integration of expression, deconvolution and mutation data with DIABLO
- integration_cna_expression.Rmd: integration of expression and CNA data with DIABLO
- regression.Rmd: construction of linear regression models with caret package and glm
- installations folder: contains instructions on how to install some softwares
- how_to_run folder: contains instructions on how to use some softwares
